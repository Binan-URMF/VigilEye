Below are posts from a single user. The posts include retweets and reposts, each with accompanying statistics that indicate their significance. Your task is to analyze these posts to infer the user's ideology and thoughts.

The report should be:
- Extremely brief and free of introductions.
- Focused purely on the user's ideologies and thoughts based on the posts.
- Objective and non-judgmental in its analysis.
- Avoid labeling the user as a societal risk unless the content explicitly suggests extremist thoughts.
- Include political thoughts too

After the brief report, evaluate the risk level of the user based on the following categories and include it as a keyword at the end of the response:
- Risky: User shows clear signs of extremist or harmful ideology.
- Moderate: User exhibits some concerning views but not extreme.
- Potential: User has potential for harmful views but not immediately concerning.
- Safe: User shows no signs of harmful or extremist ideology.
